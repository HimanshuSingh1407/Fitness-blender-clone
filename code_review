Things to Improve:


1. Your commits names are poor, always have a meaningful commit name and PR name.
2. Always make small commits and commit names should be relevant to what the code change you have done like fixed some bug, or added config etc etc.
3. Add a lot of comments in your code as it will help anyone to understand what you have done.
4. Try to use OOPs concepts like abstraction in your code to have much more control over the data flow.
5. You can add test cases in your code so if someone else tries to change something it shouldnâ€™t break the whole project as a failure in the test case can tell you what is broken.
6. Next time add MVC architecture and try to have a local DB setup at least to store credentials etc.
7. Functions are too large and make sure you break down the functionalities.
8. Never push large changes under a single commit as it is impossible to review 20k plus lines of code.
9. You have taken most of the code from existing websites, try to write your own code as much as possible.
10. Backend code can be improved by creating proper schema diagrams and adding more authentication etc.


Things I liked:
1. Used ES6 syntax like maps which is a good coding practice..
2. Have used a decent enough structure to differentiate your codebase in different sections like src, public, route etc.
3. The class structure and functions have proper meanings which makes it easier to understand.
4. Most of the functions describe the use cases for which they are defined and solve 1 functionality.
5. Variable names are thoughtfully chosen and are self explanatory.
6. Almost all the required functionalities are there from frontend perspective..
7. First project with proper backend code, and haven't used a simple mock.
8. Backend code is decent enough to execute the basic functionalities.
